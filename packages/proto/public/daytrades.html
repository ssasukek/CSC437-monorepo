            <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
            <p>
                Day trading involves several key steps and tools that work together in a fast-paced environment:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Real-time Data Monitoring:</strong> Traders continuously monitor live market data through trading platforms that offer real-time quotes, charts, and news feeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Technical Analysis & Charting:</strong> Using technical indicators (such as moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands), traders analyze chart patterns to identify entry and exit signals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Strategic Order Placement:</strong> Based on analysis, traders execute orders using various types such as market, limit, or stop orders. These tools help secure optimal entry points and manage risk through automated triggers like stop-loss orders.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Risk Management:</strong> Effective risk management is essential. Traders set predefined risk levels, use stop-loss orders, and allocate only a portion of their capital to each trade to limit potential losses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Trade Execution & Monitoring:</strong> Once an order is placed, the trading system automatically executes the trade when conditions are met. Traders then monitor their open positions throughout the day, making adjustments based on market movement and new data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Closing Positions:</strong> All positions are closed before the market ends to avoid overnight exposure, ensuring that every trade concludes within the same day.
                </li>
            </ul>
