          <h2>What is a Brokerage Account?</h2>
          <p>
            A brokerage account is a financial account that allows you to buy
            and sell securities such as stocks, ETFs, and options. It acts as a
            bridge between individual investors and the stock market.
          </p>
          <p>
            For day traders, the right brokerage account offers essential tools
            such as fast order execution, real-time data, and access to margin
            trading.

          <h2>Types of Brokerage Accounts</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Cash Account:</strong> You trade using only the funds
            deposited. No borrowing is allowed, which limits risk but also
            leverage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Margin Account:</strong> Allows you to borrow money from the
            broker to trade. This can amplify gainsâ€”but also losses. Margin
            accounts are required for short selling and pattern day trading.
          </p>

          <h2>Important Regulations</h2>
          <p>
            If you're flagged as a Pattern Day Trader (PDT), you're required to
            maintain a minimum account balance of $25,000 in a margin account.
            Brokers enforce this under FINRA rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            Violating PDT rules may result in account restrictions, including
            trade limitations or conversion to a cash account.
