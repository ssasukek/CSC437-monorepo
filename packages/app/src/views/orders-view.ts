            <h2>Understanding Orders</h2>
            <p>
                In day trading, orders are the set of instructions you send to your broker to execute trades under specific conditions.
                They not only dictate how and when your trades are executed, but they also help you manage risk and seize short-term opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Different order types provide you with varying levels of control over execution speed, price certainty, and overall trade management.
